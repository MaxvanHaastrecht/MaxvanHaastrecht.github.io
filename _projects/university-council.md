On the 17th of May I was [elected](https://www.organisatiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staff-and-student-participation/university-elections/election-results-2022) to the University Council of Leiden University. I will be one of the 8 employees representing our colleagues in the council. As a representative of [PhDoc](https://www.organisatiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staff-and-student-participation/university-council/staff-parties/phdoc), I will focus my attention on the challenges for PhDs and postdocs at our university and how we can find creative solutions. I'm really looking forward to my term in the university council, which will run from September 2022 - August 2024 (Â± 10 hours per week).
