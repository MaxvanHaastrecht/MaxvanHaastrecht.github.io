As part of my University Council work for PhDoc, I initiated an investigation into the use of annual agreements among early career academics at our university. Annual agreements provide employees with some flexibility regarding their holiday days, but have been criticised recently because they have many negative consequences, especially for early career academics. If you're interested in improving working conditions at our universities, I hope you'll take the time to read the [full report](https://twitter.com/PhDocUniv/status/1633395510269693953?s=20). We discussed the report with the university board, who indicated they were grateful for our work and were going to implement changes to mitigate the issues with annual agreements.
