I wrote some code to create a personalised street map in Python. Initially this was a gift idea, but I ended up also writing an article about it on Medium. You can find it [here](https://medium.com/@maxvanhaastrecht/create-your-own-city-street-map-in-python-f353fa0cda05) if you're interested. Let me know if you like it!
