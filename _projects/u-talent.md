Together with a group of high school students we are building a cybersecurity escape room and using it to answer some interesting research questions regarding framing of security content. The project is part of the [U-Talent programme](https://u-talent.nl/), an initiative to provide talented high school students with the opportunity to get in touch with real scientists.
