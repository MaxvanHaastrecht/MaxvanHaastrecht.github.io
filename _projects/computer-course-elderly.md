Together with [Buurtwerkkamer TOP](https://buurtwerkkamer.nl/buurtwerkkamers/top-utrecht/), I am organizing a computer course for elderly people in my neighbourhood in Utrecht. We will cover basic topics such as Microsoft Office, e-mail, and web browsing. Sometimes people without many digital skills can feel left out. The hope is that we will be able to give people the confidence to interact more with the online world. Want to know more about this project and how you can help out people in your neighbourhood? Feel free to get in touch!
