###### A BSc [course](https://www.cs.uu.nl/education/vak/INFOB3INSE) for Information Science students taught by dr. Fabiano Dalpiaz. Students learn about basic security principles and we dive deep into security requirements using STS-ml. This year we introduced a privacy component based on the [LINDDUN](https://www.linddun.org/) privacy threat framework, which we explained to the students using the fun LINDDUN GO game. Dr. Dalpiaz and I were awarded a 'Pluim' for this course in recognition of our distinguished teaching.
