###### A [course](http://www.cs.uu.nl/education/vak.php?stijl=2&vak=INFOMDSS) under the auspices of dr. Marco Spruit, introducing master students to the exciting area of Applied Data Science.

###### My role in this course was to coordinate assignments, as well as giving a couple of lectures on the topics of Descriptive Statistics and Unsupervised Learning. The course was very well received, with students rating my lectures with 4.5/5.
