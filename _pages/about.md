<p>Read about my publications, teaching, talks, and more. My work focuses on the validity of data science solutions for (cybersecurity) education. I strongly believe we need to be more mindful of the fairness and trustworthiness of our technical solutions.</p>

<p>Michel de Montaigne once said: <em>I quote others only in order the better to express myself.</em> These quotes express who I aspire to be:</p>
  
<p><em>I never lose. I either win or learn.</em> - Nelson Mandela</p>

<p><em>Don't raise your voice, improve your argument.</em> - Desmond Tutu</p>

<p><em>The things you regret most in life are the things you didn't do.</em> - Steve Jobs</p>

<p><em>True humility is not thinking less of yourself, it is thinking of yourself less.</em> - C.S. Lewis</p>
  
<p><em>Do not judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant.</em> - R.L. Stevenson</p>
