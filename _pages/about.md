<p>Michel de Montaigne once said: <em>I quote others only in order the better to express myself.</em> So, to give you some sense of what I find interesting and important, here are some quotes by others that express who I am:</p>

<p><em>The things you regret most in life are the things you didn't do.</em> - Steve Jobs</p>

<p><em>Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less.</em> - C.S. Lewis</p>
  
<p><em>Don't raise your voice, improve your argument.</em> - Desmond Tutu</p>
  
<p><em>Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.</em> - Albert Einstein</p>
  
<p><em>Do not judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant.</em> - Robert Louis Stevenson</p>

<p>Lastly, not a quote but a video. A commencement address by Steve Jobs at Stanford. The most inspiring speech I have ever seen. Watch the full 15 minutes, you won't regret it.</p>
