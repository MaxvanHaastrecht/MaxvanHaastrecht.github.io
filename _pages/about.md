Read about my publications, teaching, talks, and more. For more information on my research, see my [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/max-van-haastrecht) page and the website of the [GEIGER project](https://project.cyber-geiger.eu/).

My work is what I do, but it doesn't always reflect who I am. Michel de Montaigne once said: *I quote others only in order the better to express myself.* So, to give you some sense of what I find interesting and important, here are some quotes by others that express who I am:

*The things you regret most in life are the things you didn't do.* - Steve Jobs

*Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less.* - C.S. Lewis
  
*Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.* - Pablo Picasso
  
*Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.* - Albert Einstein
  
*Do not judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant.* - Robert Louis Stevenson

Lastly, not a quote but a video. A commencement address by Steve Jobs at Stanford. The most inspiring speech I have ever seen.
