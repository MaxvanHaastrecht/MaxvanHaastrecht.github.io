Read about my publications, teaching, talks, and more. For more information on my research, see my [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/MANHaastrecht) page and the website of the [GEIGER project](https://project.cyber-geiger.eu/).

My work is what I do, but it doesn't always reflect who I am. Michel de Montaigne once said: <i>I quote others only in order the better to express myself.<i/>
  
So, to give you some sense of what I find interesting and important, here are some quotes by others that express who I am:
  
<i>Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less.<i/> - C.S. Lewis
  
<i>Opportunities multiply as they are seized.<i/> - Sun Tzu

<i>For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.<i/> - Richard Feynman
  
<i>A mind is like a parachute, it does not work if it is not open.<i/> - Frank Zappa
  
And, last but not least:
  
<i>Do not judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant.<i/> - Robert Louis Stevenson
