Read about my publications, teaching, talks, and more. For more information on my research, see my [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/max-van-haastrecht) page and the website of the [GEIGER project](https://project.cyber-geiger.eu/).

My work is what I do, but it doesn't always reflect who I am. Michel de Montaigne once said: <em>I quote others only in order the better to express myself.</em> So, to give you some sense of what I find interesting and important, here are some quotes by others that express who I am:

 <em>The things you regret most in life are the things you didn't do.</em> - Steve Jobs

<em>Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less.</em> - C.S. Lewis
  
<em>Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.</em> - Pablo Picasso
  
<em>Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.</em> - Albert Einstein
  
<em>Do not judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant.</em> - Robert Louis Stevenson

Lastly, not a quote but a video. A commencement address by Steve Jobs at Stanford. The most inspiring speech I have ever seen.
