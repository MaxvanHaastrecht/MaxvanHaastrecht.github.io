A journal [paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3576050.3576060) which was the culmination of two years of work on the validation of socio-technical systems. After many discussions in 2021 on how to bring validity theory from computer science and education together, we put our ideas into practice within the [GEIGER](https://cyber-geiger.eu/) project in 2022, eventually resulting in the VAST validation framework we present in this study.
