A short [paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3576050.3576060) resulting from a collaboration with our colleagues from the University of Education in Freiburg, Germany. We argue that the field of learning analytics needs to embrace interpretivistic criteria such as trustworthiness and authenticity when validating learning analytics systems. We received a nomination for Best Short Paper for our work.
