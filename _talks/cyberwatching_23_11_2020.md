I gave a talk at the Cyberwatching.eu [Cybersecurity Risk Management](https://www.cyberwatching.eu/cybersecurity-risk-management-how-strengthen-resilience-and-adapt-2021) webinar. The talk and the rest of the [webinar](https://youtu.be/YHDSkCpmGBQ) are well worth a watch if you are interested in current cybersecurity research projects and directions.
