I was one of the speakers at the first [ASReview Users Meeting](https://asreview.nl/academy/users-meeting/). I spoke about the opportunities presented by combining ASReview and snowballing, a topic we covered in our [2021 SYMBALS paper](https://doi.org/10.3389/frma.2021.685591). Overall, a really cool experience where we got the chance to discuss the future of ASReview with developers, researchers, and users.
